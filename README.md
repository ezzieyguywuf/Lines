## What?

This repository explores different ways of rendering wide lines using OpenGL. Rather than a library, it is meant to be a
number of reference implementations to produce thick, antialiased lines in OpenGL. Currently there are 5 implementations
availabe in this repo:

1. OpenGL lines - using `glLineWidth(width_value)` functionality.
2. CPU lines - extending lines to quads on the CPU.
3. Geometry Shaders - extending lines to quads on GPU during Geometry Shader stage.
4. Instancing Lines - hijacing the instancing functionality to render a number of line segments by repeating instanced quad.
5. Texture buffer lines - using combination of a texture that stores line data and gl_VertexID to generate quads in Vertex Shader.

For simplicity, the implementation assume vertex buffer where each pair of points creates a line segment (`GL_LINES` behavior)

## Why?

The reason for exploring different implementations of wide line rendering is steming from the fact that using the build-in OpenGL functionality for this task is very limited, if working at all. While combining `glLineWidth(width_values)` and `glEnable(GL_LINE_SMOOTH)` **"can"** be used to produce antialiased lines, there are a number of issues:

- No guarantee that this approach will work. Implementations of OpenGL vary across systems - the `glGet( GL_LINE_WIDTH_RANGE, range)` can simply tell you that your implementation only supports a range (1.0,1.0], leading to effectively no control over the line width. On my system at the time of writing (NVidia GTX 1070 Max-Q, OpenGL 4.5, driver 441.08) the supported `GL_LINE_WIDTH_RANGE` is [1.0, 10.0]. As such I am able to produce image below, but your milage may vary:

- Limited range. As stated above the `glGet( GL_LINE_WIDTH_RANGE, ...)` line width will return supported range - creating lines with widths outside this range will fail. For example, using implementations 1 (using `GL_LINES` + `glLineWidth`) vs other four will produce following images when asking to draw 15 lines segments with widths between 1 and 15 pixels:

- No control over AA. `glEnable(GL_LINE_SMOOTH)` enables anti-aliasing, however we have no control over this behavior. The custom implementations (2-5) allow user to specify the width of the smoothed region. In the figure below the smoothing radius is varied between 0 and 5 pixels wide:

- No control over line width within a drawcall. Due to the nature of `glLineWidth(width_value)` the line width need to constant within a drawcall. This means multiple drawcalls needs to be issue to render lines with varying widths. In contrast, the custom implementation expose line width as a per-vertex attribute, allowing to render variable-width
lines with a single draw call.

## Methods

All custom line-drawing methods follow the same baseline paradigm - drawing a quad that is oriented as the line segment, and aligned with the viewport. The gross simplification of the general algorithm is:

1. Transform line segment end points `p` and `q` to normalized device space. At this point we work in 2D space, regardless of whether original line was specified as 2D or 3D line. 
2. Calculate direction `d`, corrected for viewport aspect ratio.
3. Calculate unit normal vector `n = {-d.y, d.x}`
4. Modulate `n` by approperiate line widths to get vectors `n_a` and `n_b` 
5. Create quad points `a = p + n_a`, `b = p - n_a`, `c = q + n_b`, `d = q - n_b`
6. Move points `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` back to clip space and pass them down the rasterization pipeline

The smoothing is done by adding the requested smoothing radius to the user-specified line width, and modifying the alpha value based on the distance from the edge, giving the quad a total width of `w+2r`, as seen below:

The circle area along the edge at length `w` from the actual line is the area of smoothing, based on ideas from
[Fast Prefiltered Lines](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems2/part-iii-high-quality-rendering/chapter-22-fast-prefiltered-lines). Essentially, the alpha value will be modulated between 0 and 1 in the region
between `h-r` and `h+r`, where `h=0.5w`:

The falloff is controlled using the GLSL build-in `smoothstep` function. 

Different method vary in terms of how a line segment between `p` and `q` is transformed
into such grid. <!-- Read on for a brief differences in implementations: -->

<!-- 
Below we discuss different variants of the method 
### CPU lines
If everything else fails, we can always just take the input buffer and use it to calculate new vertex locations.

### Geometry Shader lines
We can utilize the geometry shaders available in OpenGL 3.3+ to produce the desired vertex data on GPU

### Instancing lines


### Texture Buffer lines

## Compilation
The project is relatively simple to build. The external dependecy not included in this repository is [glfw3](https://www.glfw.org/). You also need a OpenGL 4.5 to run this code, due to usage of OpenGL DSA APIs.

If you have a command line compiler like clang of gcc, and glfw3 is in path, you could simply something similar to this to your terminal (Â± the OpenGL libs, depending on your system)

```
gcc -std=c11 -I. extern/glad.c main.c -o lines -lglfw3 -lopengl32
```

The source tree also includes a CMakeLists.txt to generate build files, if that's your jam. I only tested it under Msys2, please let me know if you have troubles compiling.
